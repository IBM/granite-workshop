    "<u>**Dynamic Prompting:**</u> The Pydantic model can then be integrated with the prompt sent to the LLM. This allows for a more dynamic interaction where the model can adapt based on the defined structure of entities. If new entities are added or existing ones modified, changes can be made at the class level without needing to rewrite the entire prompt.  \n",
