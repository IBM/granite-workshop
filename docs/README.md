# Granite Workshop

Welcome to our workshop! In this workshop we'll be using the InstructLab CLI to install and run a quantized Granite model before adding our own knowledge.
After this we will show the simplified contribution workflow throught the [InstructLab UI](https://qa.ui.instructlab.ai/).

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

* Understand what Granite is and its general use cases.
* Understand what InstructLab is and its general use cases.
* Walk away with a local AI Co-Pilot for free, secure and air gapped!
* Create and test your own knowledge and skill submissions locally using the CLI and UI
* Learn a suggested workflow on how to fine tune a model with new knowledge and skills!
