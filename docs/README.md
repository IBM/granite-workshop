# Introduction

Welcome to our workshop! In this workshop we'll be using the open-sourced [IBM Granite
AI foundation models](https://www.ibm.com/granite) for a number of use cases that
demonstrates the value of [generative AI](https://developer.ibm.com/generative-ai-for-developers).

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

* Summarize a text document using [text summarization](https://www.ibm.com/topics/text-summarization)
* Generate specific information from a large document using the [RAG](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG) technique
* Predict future trends using [time series forecasting](https://research.ibm.com/blog/AI-time-series-forecasting)
* Extract entities from an unstructured text document using [entity recognition](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/named-entity-recognition)
* Multimodal RAG using a [multimodal](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/multimodal-ai) LLM (MLLM) on a PDF file with images.
