# Document Summarization with Granite

[Text summarization](https://www.ibm.com/topics/text-summarization) condenses one or more texts into shorter summaries for enhanced information extraction.

The goal of this lab is to show how you can use [IBM Granite](https://www.ibm.com/granite/docs/models/granite/) models in order to apply document summarization techniques to a large document.

## Prerequisites

This lab is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Please follow the instructions in [pre-work](../pre-work/README.md) to run the lab.

To run the notebook from your command line in Jupyter using the active virtual environment from the [pre-work](../pre-work/README.md#install-jupyter), run:

```shell
jupyter notebook notebooks/Summarize.ipynb
```

The path of the notebook file above is relative to the `granite-workshop` folder from the git clone in the [pre-work](../pre-work/README.md#clone-the-granite-workshop-repository).
